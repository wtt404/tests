# Tried in order. "openrouter/free" is OpenRouter's own auto-router - it picks
# from whatever free models are currently available, which matters because
# the free model lineup on OpenRouter rotates often (models get pulled or
# rate-limited without notice). The pinned model after it is a long-standing,
# stable free model kept as a backup in case the auto-router itself has an
# issue, giving us redundancy across providers rather than a single point of
# failure.
